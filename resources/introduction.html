<p>Before you begin you should:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Organize your photos on your hard drive so that there is a single folder for each camera deployment. Each folder should contain only the image files that were produced during the deployment, and should include ALL image files, even if there are no animals in the picture. You will use the Photo Uploader once for each camera deployment.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have the latitude and longitude information for where the camera was located during the deployment and that you know the start date and end date that the camera was in the field.</li>
    <li>Make sure you know your Nature Up North username and password. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@natureupnorth.org">info@natureupnorth.org</a> for assistance if needed.</li>
